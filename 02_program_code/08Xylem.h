    Each layer layer contains a root element connected to a rhizosphere component.

    There are five horizontal layers.

    Biomass_fraction is determined as follows:

    \Beta = 1 - \beta^d, where \Beta is fraction of biomass above depth d in cm, 
    and 0 < \beta < 1. Max root depth set at \Beta = 0.995.

            paths that drain given a known P_soil. There are then N + 1 unknown
