# Example Outputs

To compare your outputs with the example output model after running with test data run the following:

```bash
diff example_out/timesteps_output_POTR_SJNF_POTR-H-A.csv ./timesteps_output_POTR_SJNF_POTR-H-A.csv
```

If nothing pops up then the installation is correct.

Inconsistencies may occur due to numerical instabilities caused by different compiler versions or different work environments.
