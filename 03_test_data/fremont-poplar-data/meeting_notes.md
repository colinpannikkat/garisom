# Kevin and Dan Meeting Notes

## trait summary
* repeated measurements
  * population
    * four populations
      * CCR - adapted to drought conditions
  * elevation
  * genotype
    * just a code
    * 5 per population
  * replicate
    * unique number
    * three replicate tree per genotype
  * repeated measurements (7 peridos)
    * morning and afternoon (am/pm)
    * 20/21st is same period
      * same period in the day
    * predrought and drought
    * measurement periods dependended on climate conditions
  * measurements
    * rh: relative humidity
    * ambient and leaf temp
    * vapor pressure deficit
      * from porometer
    * stomatal conductance
    * transpiration
      * transpiration in different units
      * will need to calculate transpiration to basal area
    * col u,v,w are water potential measurements
      * ypd: predwan
      * ymd: midday
    * calculate whole plant conductance
* one (/two) time measurements
  * measured before and after the drought
  * SLA measured once
  * Rooting depth
  * Tree height
  * predrought/postdrought basal area
  * ground area
    * surface area to pot
  * predrought basal area to ground area
  * mean leaf width
    * averaged leafs
  * pre/post drought Anet under optimal conditions
  * pre/post vcmax jmax
  * estimated root area, at least one per genotype
* stem hydraulics
  * repeated measurements from the same tree
  * some replicates missing data

## Abiotic data
### Soil release curves
* Matric potential 
* Ran for soil in each population

### Water amount pots
* Watering time periods, total amount of water (mm) per day
  * For each pot every day
  * Everything was droughted

### Soil properties
* soil densities, bulk density, total soil volume

### Saturated water content
* Tin method
  * Volumetric water content

### Irrigation
* Has irrigation for before started, during, after
* Hourly to match weather station data

## Meteorological data
* weather_hourly
  * no VPD, tsoil
    * par sensor for solar radiation
  * calculate VPD easily
